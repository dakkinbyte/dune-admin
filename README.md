# dune-admin

Web-based admin panel for a Dune Awakening private server. Works against any deployment topology — CubeCoders AMP (podman or docker), k3s/k8s over SSH, Docker containers, or a bare-metal install.

## 🙏 Thank You

A huge thank you to **[@adainrivers](https://github.com/adainrivers)** and the [**dune-dedicated-server-manager**](https://github.com/adainrivers/dune-dedicated-server-manager) project.

The RabbitMQ server command integration in dune-admin — the envelope format, auth token, AMQP publish path, and the complete catalogue of working server commands — was made possible by the research and live-testing work done in that project. Without it, we would not have known which commands actually work over MQ, what the correct field names are, or that the outer envelope must be base64-encoded before publishing via `rabbitmqctl eval`.

If you run a Dune Awakening private server, check out their project — it is a full-featured dedicated server manager with a Tauri desktop frontend.

## Quick install

On a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 host with passwordless sudo and your game-server stack already running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Icehunter/dune-admin/main/scripts/install.sh \
  | bash
```

The script installs the build toolchain (Go 1.26, Node 22 LTS, pnpm 10.28, build-essential), clones the source, builds the binary and SPA, and installs them into `/opt/dune-admin/`. It refuses to overwrite a running service and leaves `.prev` backups for one-step rollback. See `--help` for flags (`--branch`, `--install-dir`, `--service-user`, `--patches-dir`, `--no-patches`).

When the script finishes it prints the next manual steps: run the setup wizard, apply the sudoers entry it generates, drop a systemd unit, and start the service.

For development or non-Ubuntu hosts, see [Manual build](#manual-build).

## Providers

Pick the provider that matches your game-server topology. Each guide covers prerequisites, wizard answers, and provider-specific config keys.

| Provider | Use when | Guide |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **amp** | Game server runs under CubeCoders AMP (host, or a podman/docker container) | [SETUP_AMP.md](SETUP_AMP.md) |
| **kubectl** | Game server runs in k3s/K8s on a remote VM | [SETUP_KUBECTL.md](SETUP_KUBECTL.md) |
| **docker** | Game server runs as Docker containers (compose or standalone) | [SETUP_DOCKER.md](SETUP_DOCKER.md) |
| **local** | Game server runs on the same machine — bare metal, LGSM, custom | [SETUP_LOCAL.md](SETUP_LOCAL.md) |

---

## Setup wizard

After install, configure dune-admin with the built-in wizard:

```bash
cd /opt/dune-admin
./dune-admin -setup
```

It asks which control plane to use, then prompts for the settings that provider needs (instance name, paths, DB credentials, etc.). When you select `amp`, the wizard auto-detects instances via `ampinstmgr -l` and pre-fills prompts with discovered values — typically you can accept the defaults straight through. For container topology it also probes the container to discover the actual game install path, so the wizard isn't pinned to any one AMP module's directory layout.

When done it writes `~/.dune-admin/config.yaml` (mode 600, never committed) and prints a sudoers entry to copy into `/etc/sudoers.d/dune-admin`.

Re-run the wizard any time your configuration changes.

---

## Deploy modes

The same binary supports three deployment shapes:

**Single-binary on a host (AMP, local Go, k3s port-forward)**

The binary serves both the API and the SPA from `./dist` next to itself. `scripts/install.sh` lays this out for you. The simplest model — one process, one port, no CDN.

**k3s / k8s cluster**

A unified manifest deploys dune-admin into a cluster with PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ alongside. Helper scripts handle kubeconfig pull, image build/import, manifest render/apply, and port-forward:

```bash
./deploy.sh        # macOS / Linux
./deploy.ps1       # Windows
```

See [SETUP_KUBECTL.md](SETUP_KUBECTL.md) for full options and troubleshooting.

**Hosted SPA + local backend**

Run the binary as an API-only process and serve the SPA from Cloudflare Pages (or any static host). The SPA prompts for a backend URL on first load, stored in localStorage. The backend adds CORS headers automatically — no extra config needed.

```bash
make deploy-web    # builds and pushes the SPA to Cloudflare Pages
```

Modern browsers allow HTTPS pages to reach HTTP localhost without mixed-content errors, so `https://your-site.pages.dev` → `http://localhost:8080` works out of the box.

## Configuration

Config is loaded in this order (first match wins per field):

1. `~/.dune-admin/config.yaml` — written by `dune-admin -setup`
2. `.env` in the working directory — legacy fallback for existing installs
3. Environment variables
4. Command-line flags

### Common fields

| Env var | Flag | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `CONTROL` | `-control` | *(auto)* | Control plane: `amp`, `kubectl`, `docker`, or `local` |
| `SSH_HOST` | `-host` | — | VM `host:port` — when set, all connections tunnel through SSH |
| `SSH_USER` | `-user` | `dune` | SSH user |
| `SSH_KEY` | `-key` | *(auto-detected)* | SSH private key path |
| `DB_HOST` | `-dbhost` | `127.0.0.1` | PostgreSQL host or Docker DNS name |
| `DB_PORT` | `-dbport` | `15432` | PostgreSQL port |
| `DB_USER` | `-dbuser` | `dune` | PostgreSQL user |
| `DB_PASS` | `-dbpass` | — | PostgreSQL password |
| `DB_NAME` | `-dbname` | `dune` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `DB_SCHEMA` | `-schema` | `dune` | PostgreSQL schema |
| `CONTROL_NAMESPACE` | `-control-ns` | *(auto-discovered)* | K8s namespace (kubectl only) |
| `BROKER_GAME_ADDR` | `-broker-game` | — | mq-game broker `host:port` |
| `BROKER_ADMIN_ADDR` | `-broker-admin` | — | mq-admin broker `host:port` |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `-backup-dir` | — | Backup directory path |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `-addr` | `:8080` | HTTP listen address |
| `SCRIP_CURRENCY` | `-scripcurrency` | `1` | Scrip currency ID |

Provider-specific fields (`docker_gameserver`, `amp_instance`, `cmd_start`, etc.) have no env var equivalents and are set via the wizard or `config.yaml` directly. See the provider guides for the full list.

### Market bot

dune-admin runs the market bot **embedded** — it's an in-process goroutine that shares the main DB pool. Enable in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
market_bot_enabled: true
market_bot_cache_db:       ~/.dune-admin/market-bot-cache.db   # auto-created (SQLite, pure Go)
market_bot_item_data:      ./item-data.json                    # falls back to standard search paths
market_bot_buy_interval:   5m
market_bot_list_interval:  30m
market_bot_buy_threshold:  1.05
market_bot_max_buys:       50
```

The Market tab's lifecycle buttons map to in-process actions:

- **Start** → `Resume()` — flips the bot's enabled flag back on
- **Stop** → `Pause()` — flips the bot's enabled flag off (goroutine stays resident)
- **Restart** → `Restart()` — pauses, reinitializes the exchange, resumes

Config edits in the Market tab apply directly to the live runtime config. A full process restart only matters when changing the cache DB path or item-data path.

See [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-embed-market-bot-as-library.md) and [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-in-process-bot-lifecycle.md) for the design rationale.

### Welcome Kits

An opt-in feature that auto-grants a configured item package to every player **once, on first login**. Manage it in the **Welcome Kits** tab, or in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
welcome_package_enabled: true
welcome_package_scan_interval_secs: 30
welcome_package_active_version: v1
welcome_packages:
  - version: v1
    items:
      - { template: AluminiumBar, qty: 5, quality: 0 }
```

dune-admin keeps a library of named packages plus an active-version pointer. An in-process scanner grants the active package once per `(player, version)`, tracked in a persistent SQLite ledger at `~/.dune-admin/welcome-package.db` (so a restart never re-grants). Bumping the active version re-issues to everyone. It defaults **off** — it mutates every player's inventory — and delivers items through the same live-RMQ + DB-fallback path as manual give-items.

### SSH key lookup order

When `SSH_KEY` / `-key` is not set, dune-admin checks these paths in order:

1. `./sshKey`
2. `~/.dune-admin/sshKey`
3. `~/.ssh/dune`
4. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
5. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

## Manual build

For development or if you'd rather not use `scripts/install.sh`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Icehunter/dune-admin
cd dune-admin

# Frontend (Vite + Rolldown — needs node-linker=hoisted for the native binding)
echo 'node-linker=hoisted' > web/.npmrc
cd web && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build && cd ..

# Backend
make linux         # cross-compile a Linux amd64 binary (dune-admin-linux)
# or
make build         # host OS binary (bin/dune-admin), plus the frontend build
```

Then run the setup wizard:

```bash
./dune-admin -setup
```

Prerequisites: Go 1.26+, Node 20.19+ or 22.12+, pnpm 10.28+, `make`.

> **Windows note:** `make build` works from PowerShell or `cmd.exe` as long as
> [GNU Make](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) is installed (e.g.
> `winget install GnuWin32.Make` or `choco install make`). The binary is named
> `dune-admin.exe`. For `make dev`, `make verify`, and the `make version-*` targets,
> run from a **Git Bash** shell (right-click the folder → "Git Bash Here") — those
> recipes use POSIX shell features that cmd.exe can't run.

---

## Development

dune-admin ships pre-commit and pre-push hooks that mirror the CI quality gate. Set them up once:

```bash
make hooks   # wires git's core.hooksPath to .githooks/
make tools   # caches golangci-lint, govulncheck, gocognit, gosec, air (via Go's go tool mechanism)
```

After that, every `git commit` runs `gofmt -w` + `go vet` + `golangci-lint` on staged Go files (and `markdownlint-cli2` on `.md` files), and every `git push` adds `gosec`, `govulncheck`, and `go test -race`. Bypass with `--no-verify` if you really need to.

You can run the full suite by hand at any time:

```bash
make verify   # fmt-check + vet + test-race + vulncheck + lint + gocognit
```

> **Windows note:** the race detector needs cgo. Either install MinGW (e.g. `winget install BrechtSanders.WinLibs.POSIX.UCRT`) or skip race testing locally and rely on the pre-push hook on a Linux dev box or CI.

## Makefile targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make setup` | Run the interactive setup wizard |
| `make build` | Build frontend + Go binary for the host OS |
| `make linux` | Cross-compile a Linux amd64 binary (`dune-admin-linux`) |
| `make dev` | Run backend + frontend in live mode (Air + Vite HMR) |
| `make dev-server` | Run backend only (`go run ./cmd/dune-admin`) |
| `make web` | Build the frontend only |
| `make deploy-web` | Build and deploy the SPA to Cloudflare Pages |
| `make render-k8s` | Render `deploy/k8s/dune-admin.rendered.yaml` from `~/.dune-admin/config.yaml` |
| `make k8s-dry-run` | Render and run `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` |
| `make test` | Run tests |
| `make verify` | Run all quality checks (fmt-check, vet, test-race, vulncheck, lint, gocognit) |
| `make hooks` | Install the pre-commit + pre-push hooks |
| `make tools` | Cache the dev toolchain (`golangci-lint`, `gosec`, etc.) |

---

## Item data (optional)

`item-data.json` provides friendly item names, stack limits, volume, tier, and rarity. It ships with the repo.

Without it the panel still works — inventory items show raw template IDs.

---

## Architecture

dune-admin is a single Go binary that exposes a REST API over the game's PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ stack. The React SPA can be served by the same binary (from `./dist`) or hosted independently (Cloudflare Pages). A control-plane abstraction (`amp` / `kubectl` / `docker` / `local`) drives lifecycle operations, log streaming, INI editing, and broker access against whatever topology you're running.
